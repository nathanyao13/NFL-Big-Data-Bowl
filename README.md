This repository contains a predictive modeling project by Dom Hoar-Weiler, Nathan Yao, and Justin Fung for the 2025 NFL Big Data Bowl, focusing on pre-snap to post-snap predictions in football. The project explores how variables such as play clock timing, down, yards to go, and player tracking data influence passing play outcomes. Using multinomial regression and neural network models, the analysis predicts pass results and provides actionable insights on optimal play clock timing to improve offensive success rates. The repository includes data processing scripts, model training code, and visualizations to present key findings.
